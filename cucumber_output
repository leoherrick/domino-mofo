Feature: Start a new Match
  As a domino player
  I want to begin a match of dominos
  So that I can pass the time away

  Scenario: MatchController sets up new match              # features/starts_match.feature:8
    Given I initiate a new match                           # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:3
    When I am welcomed                                     # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:8
    And I am prompted to select my number of opponents     # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:14
    And I choose 3 opponents                               # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:20
    And I am prompted to select the number of houses       # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:24
    And I choose 5 houses                                  # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:30
    And the match is started                               # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:34
    Then I should see "A'ight Playa. Let's do this thing." # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:39
    And an empty scorecard for 4 players should exist      # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:44

  Scenario: MatchController starts first game            # features/starts_match.feature:19
    Given I have started a match with 4 players          # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:49
    Then a new game should start                         # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:67
    And there should be 4 players                        # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:72
    And each player should have 7 dominoes in their hand # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:77
    And the boneyard should be empty                     # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:81

  Scenario: I have highest pair                 # features/starts_match.feature:26
    Given I have started a match with 4 players # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:49
    And I have boxcars                          # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:58
    When I have the highest pair                # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:86
    Then I should be prompted to play           # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:91

  Scenario: A computer player has highest pair           # features/starts_match.feature:32
    Given I have started a match with 4 players          # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:49

    Then the computer should play that bone on the board # features/step_definitions/starts_match_steps.rb:106


Feature: Basic CPU Play
  As a domino player
  I want the cpu to automatically play bones in turn
  So that the board will evolve between my turns

  Scenario: Cpu plays scoring domino after lead-out has been played # features/basic_cpu_logic.feature:8
    Given I'm playing in a match                                    # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:1
    And the board has a single domino (the 6-6)                     # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:9
    And its the cpu's turn to play                                  # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:17
    And the cpu has a 6-3, a 6-2, and a 5-5 in its hand             # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:24
    When the cpu plays                                              # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:31
      TODO (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:32:in `/^the cpu plays$/'
      features/basic_cpu_logic.feature:13:in `When the cpu plays'
    Then the domino played should have been the 6-3                 # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:35
    And the 3 of the 6-3 should become an open-end on the board     # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:39
    And the 6 of the 6-6 should remain an open-end on the board     # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:43
    And the cpu should score 15 points                              # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:47
    And the cpu's turn should be over                               # features/step_definitions/basic_cpu_logic_steps.rb:51
